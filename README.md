(E.g. encourages others to improve their own delivery; manages dependencies on other projects and teams; balances short-term delivery with longer term objectives of own and other teams).<br/><br/>Committed to meeting their team’s objective and key results. (E.g. adapts delivery approach to meet the needs of the team, unblocks obstacles and supports the team in delivering its goals).<br/><br/>Regularly takes on more difficult tasks which require input from various teams or disciplines. | Plays a leading role in planning technical strategy for the team, or shaping the team’s delivery plans.<br/><br/>Makes their team successful in meeting their objectives and key results.<br/><br/>Balances risks to ensure team delivery.<br/><br/>Monitors system and delivery pipeline health to ensure quality of service and team productivity.<br/><br/>Brings the team or multiple teams together to maintain delivery pace and quality during periods of change and uncertainty.<br/><br/>Communicates and documents their work thoroughly. | Plays a strategic role in the stream’s technical decision making.<br/><br/>Produces high quality code which defines stream standards, and inspires other engineers’ delivery.<br/><br/>Provides feedback on important PRs and team’s solution design sessions.<br/><br/>Fosters a culture of continuous improvement and high delivery momentum across the stream.<br/><br/>Balances short term goals and long term needs.<br/><br/>Focuses on high impact and high value work.<br/><br/>Demonstrates understanding that delivery is more than just their individual contribution. (E.g. Delegates learning opportunities; encourages others to improve their own delivery; manages dependencies on other projects and teams).<br/><br/>Committed to meeting their team’s objective and key results.<br/><br/>Helps to unblock obstacles and supports the team in delivering its goals.  <br/><br/>Takes responsibility of their code from local testing to supporting it in production. | Lead Developers make successful delivery outcomes happen, for example by:<br/><br/>Tech leading a significant engineering project which requires coordination with many other teams and disciplines within GNM.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>Turning around the delivery trajectory of a struggling team.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>Strategically contributing to the department’s technical and organisational decision making. |
